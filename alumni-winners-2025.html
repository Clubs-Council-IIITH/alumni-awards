                        Alumna of the 2001 batch, Dr. Naveena Yanamala, PhD, graduated with an MSIT in Bioinformatics
                        from IIIT Hyderabad and obtained her Ph.D in Medicine with focus on Integrated Systems Biology
                        from the University of Pittsburgh in 2009. She is currently an Associate Professor of Medicine,
                        Section Chief of Clinical Research & AI Innovation, Director of AI/ML Research, and Director of
                        the Center for Innovation at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Jersey. In
                        addition, she is a Special Government Employee of the US FDA and an Adjunct Faculty at Carnegie
                        Mellon University in the Software and Societal Systems Department (S3D). She played a pivotal
                        role in stabilizing the ambitious MSIT program at IIIT Hyderabad, which ultimately led to the
                        establishment of the Bioinformatics Research Center, later evolving into the Center for
                        Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics (CCNSB).

                        Dr. Yanamala held several leadership positions in occupational safety and health research
                        governance, including serving on the steering committee of the Center for Occupational Robotics
                        Research (CORR) within the Division of Safety Research at the Centers for Disease Control and
                        Prevention (CDC). With over 15 years of interdisciplinary research experience, Dr. Yanamala has
                        authored more than 100 peer-reviewed articles at the intersection of biology, health, and
                        computation. Her innovative work in risk assessment and stratification using machine learning,
                        especially in cardiovascular disease and environmental exposures, has earned her widespread
                        recognition. She received multiple Alice Hamilton Awards for exceptional contributions to
                        occupational and environmental health, as well as nominations for the Charles C. Shepard Science
                        Award, the CDC's highest recognition for scientific excellence.

                        Her contributions have also been recognized within the clinical and cardiology community, where
                        her work received multiple recognitions and Best Paper award from the American College of
                        Cardiology. In 2020, her team won the NIH NHLBI Big Data Analysis Challenge, a national award
                        spotlighting innovation in data science and cardiovascular health. Most recently, she was
                        honored with the Dean's Inaugural Faculty Excellence Award in Clinical Research from Rutgers
                        Medical School, underscoring her sustained impact as a leader in clinical research,
                        translational AI, and computational medicine.
